  abstract={Responsive predicates are clause-embedding predicates like
English know and guess that can take both declarative and interrogative clausal complements. The meanings of responsive
predicates when they take a declarative complement and when
they take an interrogative complement are hypothesized to be
constrained in systematic ways across languages, suggesting
that these constraints represent semantic universals. We report
an artificial language learning experiment showing that one of
these proposed constraints is indeed reflected in the inferences
participants make while learning a novel responsive predicate.
Our results add support to a growing body of evidence linking
semantic universals to learning.},

    abstract = "{Many languages have words that can be interpreted either as question words or as existentials. We call such words quexistentials. It has been claimed in the literature (e.g., Haida 2007) that, across languages, quexistentials are (a) always focused on their interrogative interpretation and (b) never focused on their existential interpretation. We refer to this as the quexistential-focus biconditional. The article makes two contributions. The first is that we offer a possible explanation for one direction of the biconditional: the fact that quexistentials are generally contrastively focused on their interrogative use. We argue that this should be seen as a particular instance of an even more general fact—namely, that interrogative words (quexistential or not) are always contrastively focused—and propose an account for this fact. The second contribution of the article concerns the other direction of the biconditional. We present evidence that, at least at face value, suggests that focus on a quexistential does not necessarily preclude an existential interpretation. Specifically, we show that it is possible for Dutch wat to be interpreted existentially even when it is focused. We attempt to explain this phenomenon.}",

  abstract = {Modified numerals, such as at least three and more than five, are known to sometimes give rise to ignorance inferences. However, there is disagreement in the literature regarding the nature of these inferences, their context dependence, and differences between at least and more than. We present a series of experiments which sheds new light on these issues. Our results show that (a) the ignorance inferences of at least are more robust than those of more than, (b) the presence and strength of the ignorance inferences triggered by both at least and more than depends on the question under discussion (QUD), and (c) whether ignorance inferences are detected in a given experimental setting depends partly on the task that participants are asked to perform (e.g., an acceptability task versus an inference task). We offer an Optimality Theoretic account of these findings. In particular, the task effect is captured by assuming that in performing an acceptability task, participants take the speaker’s perspective in order to determine whether an expression is optimal given a certain epistemic state, while in performing an inference task they take the addressee’s perspective in order to determine what the most likely epistemic state of the speaker is given a certain expression. To execute the latter task in a fully rational manner, participants have to perform higher-order reasoning about alternative expressions the speaker could have used. Under the assumption that participants do not always perform such higher-order reasoning but also often resort to so-called unidirectional optimization, the task effect finds a natural explanation. This also allows us to relate our finding to asymmetries between comprehension and production that have been found in language acquisition.},

	abstract={In this paper, we define a multi-type calculus for inquisitive logic, which is sound, complete and enjoys Belnap-style cut-elimination and subformula property. Inquisitive logic is the logic of inquisitive semantics, a semantic framework developed by Groenendijk, Roelofsen and Ciardelli which captures both assertions and questions in natural language. Inquisitive logic adopts the so-called support semantics (also known as team semantics). The Hilbert-style presentation of inquisitive logic is not closed under uniform substitution, and some axioms are sound only for a certain subclass of formulas, called flat formulas. This and other features make the quest for analytic calculi for this logic not straightforward. We develop a certain algebraic and order-theoretic analysis of the team semantics, which provides the guidelines for the design of a multi-type environment accounting for two domains of interpretation, for flat and for general formulas, as well as for their interaction. This multi-type environment in its turn provides the semantic environment for the multi-type calculus for inquisitive logic we introduce in this paper.}

@article{Simons:05,
	abstract = {In this paper, the meanings of sentences containing the word or and a modal verb are used to arrive at a novel account of the meaning of or coordinations. It is proposed that or coordinations denote sets whose members are the denotations of the disjuncts; and that the truth conditions of sentences containing or coordinations require the existence of some set made available by the semantic environment which can be `divided up' in accordance with the disjuncts. The relevant notion of `dividing things up' is made explicit in the paper. Detailed attention is given to the question of how the proposed truth conditions are derived from the syntactic input. The account offered allows for the derivation of both the disjunctive and the non-disjunctive readings of modal/or sentences, including the much-discussed `free choice' readings of may/or sentences.},

@inproceedings{Jager:96,
	abstract = {This chapter aims to extend the coverage of the dynamic paradigm to phenomena involving the focus sensitive operator only. Constructions involving this item show a dependency on linguistic context reminiscent to the behavior of anaphora. Existing approaches address this phenomenon by weakening the compositionality of interpretation in several respects. The chapter outlines a dynamic theory of the semantics of these constructions that preserves compositionality both on the sentence and on the text level. The semantics of ULQA makes use of a kind of simulated partiality. The implicit universal quantification introduced by only-constructions is restricted by contextual information. According to Rooth (1992), these constructions nevertheless involve classical universal quantification which is restricted by a syntactically present anaphor. The chapter concludes that the semantics of universal quantification is changed in such a way that it is restricted implicitly by the context.},

	abstract = {Jeroen Groenendijk introduced a logic, which he called the Logic of Interrogation (LoI), that can be used to analyze which linguistic answers are appropriate in response to a given question. Groenendijk gave only a semantic definition of his logic. For practical applications like building question-answering systems, understanding of the proof theory of this logic is needed. This chapter bridges this gap by providing a sound and complete axiomatization for Lol. It presents a connection between entailment in LoI and Beth's definability theorem for first-order logic. The chapter explains how LoI can be seen not only as a logic for reasoning about linguistic questions and answers, but also with natural interpretations in mathematics, database theory, and philosophical logic. Finally, it shows not only a natural linguistic interpretation, but also describes equivalence relations between models, reductions among database queries, and logicality of operations.},

	abstract = {This dissertation presents a precise, unified and explanatory theory of human conversation, centered on two broad phenomena: exhaustivity implications and intonational meaning. In a nutshell: (i) speakers have two types of communicative intentions, namely information sharing and attention sharing, (ii) these types of intentions ideally comply with a certain set of rationality criteria, or maxims, (iii) speakers of English and related languages use intonation, in particular socalled trailing tones and boundary tones, to indicate whether such compliance is achieved, and (iv) exhaustivity implications arise when this holds, at least, for the attention-sharing intention. 
The research presented here goes against a number of widespread assumptions in the field. The result is a perspective on conversation that enables new solutions to a broad range of well-known puzzles surrounding exhaustivity and intonation. Among these are the ``symmetry problem'', the ``epistemic step'' without a competence assumption, the role of informationally redundant disjuncts, the bias expressed by rising declaratives, the range of uses of rise-fall-rise intonation, the effects of different intonation contours in lists, and differences between questions with rising and falling intonation.},

The resulting framework is motivated on technical and conceptual grounds. 
The empirical picture of question embedding is explored, and the different readings exhibited by embedded questions are organised along a set of interpretive features. This determines the desiderata for the subsequent formal implementation. A grammar fragment is devised, which can capture the semantics of interrogative and declarative clauses embedded under responsive verbs: interrogative-embedding and declarative-embedding uses of responsive verbs receive a uniform treatment. The proposed account allows to express several different readings of sentences with embedded questions, deriving the differences between those readings from the interplay between the embedding predicates and various elements in the semantics of the embedded clauses.},

	abstract = {This thesis develops inquisitive conditional-doxastic logic, obtained by enriching classical multi-agent plausibility models with issues for each agent. The aim of these models is to allow for a finer approach to modelling inquiry. 
Issues capture informative and interrogative content, and so by associating an issue to an agent we are able to capture both their information state and their inquisitive state, while a plausibility map on worlds captures their doxastic state. Moreover, inquisitive plausibility models allow for conditionalisation on both informative and interrogative content. 
Two conditional-doxastic modalities are introduced and axiomatised; a considers modality unique to inquisitive conditional-doxastic logic, which conditionalises on issues with respect to both an agent's doxastic and inquisitive state, and a generalisation of (conditional) belief, which conditionalises solely on an agent's doxastic state. 
We show that inquisitive conditional-doxastic logic encodes the same assumptions concerning conditionalisation and conditional-doxastic logic. And, just as conditionaldoxastic logic may be taken as the static counterpart to a dynamic logic of belief revision, inquisitive conditional-doxastic logic can be taken as the static counterpart to a dynamic logic of belief revision within an enriched setting that includes formal resources to model interrogatives. 
Inquisitive conditional-doxastic logic is shown to be sound and complete with respect to inquisitive plausibility models, and it is shown that both (conditional) belief and knowledge modalities can be defined in terms of the considers modality. However, we also show that the entertains modality of inquisitive epistemic logic cannot be defined by the considers modality. Therefore, as the basic inquisitive conditional-doxastic logic is axiomatised solely by the considers modality over the base inquisitive semantics it cannot be used to reason about an agent's inquisitive state independently of their doxastic state. 
For this reason, we also axiomatise inquisitive plausibility logic and show it is sound and complete with respect to the same class of inquisitive plausibility models. This logic introduces modalities which restrict the issue associated to each agent to the worlds considered at least as plausible as the current world or state of evaluation, and those strictly less plausible. The entertains modality of inquisitive epistemic logic is taken as basic in the axiomatisation of inquisitive plausibility logic, and we show the considers modality of basic inquisitive conditional-doxastic logic is definable. Therefore, inquisitive plausibility logic allows for a full study of the interaction between epistemic and conditional-doxastic modalities within the framework of inquisitive semantics.},

They received a lot of attention from different view points, e.g. presupposition theory and the study of scalar implicatures. However, these particles did not receive as much attention when occurring in questions (with the exception from focus intervention effects). Concentrating on too we present interesting data points on too in alternative questions, plain polar questions, and who-questions, showing that too is infelicitous in some questions, but not all. We restrict ourselves thereby to questions in matrix form. The explanation of these data would be a first step towards a general account of the distribution of too in questions. 
In order to explain the data points, the thesis will develop a compositional inquisitive semantics with focus and presuppositions: CRISP. This is motivated both conceptually and technically, since the few accessible frameworks for such a study are either technically restricted, or conceptually ill-suited. We will show that CRISP can account for the data points.},

We study several properties of DNA-logics and DNA-varieties and we prove a version of Tarski and Birkhoff Theorems for DNA-varieties. A special attention is then paid to introduce a notion of locally finiteness for this setting and to prove two key results concerning this property, i.e. that the DNA-variety of all Heyting algebras is not locally finite and that locally finite DNA-logics can be axiomatised by a version of Jankov formulas. Finally, we apply the general theory of DNA-logics to the case of inquisitive logic. We show that InqB is a DNA-logic and we use the method of Jankov formulas to prove that the sublattice Λ(InqB) of the extensions of InqB is dually isomorphic to ω + 1.},

@mastersthesis{Pesetsky:18,
	abstract = {A very general intuition about conditionals is that they ask us to consider their consequents in light of their antecedents. Different theories cash out this intuition in different ways, but one common assumption is that an agent parsing a conditional must consider only the ways in which the antecedent affects the information and issues present in discourse. In this thesis, I argue that one must also consider the conventional discourse effects brought about by its antecedent. 
My central argument comes from the contrast between `if so' and `if yes'. While the former can occur felicitously as a response either to a question or to an assertion, the latter can only occur in response to a question. This restriction cannot arise from constraints on informational or inquisitive content, since `so' and `yes' have the same content when they are anaphoric to the same proposition. Rather, it must arise from the fact that `yes' commits its speaker to its anaphoric antecedent on the basis of their private inquisitive-evidentiary state (i.e. it creates a self-sourced commitment), while `so' creates a commitment based exclusively on testimony (i.e. a dependent commitment). Therefore, this contrast motivates a treatment of conditionals which is sensitive to these kinds of discourse-level distinctions. 
To explain this data, I propose a stack-based analysis of conditionals in which an `if so' conditional creates a temporary hypothetical context where the speaker has a dependent commitment, while `if yes' creates a hypothetical context where the speaker has a self-sourced commitment. I show that this analysis can help us make sense of factual conditionals, an otherwise mysterious class of conditionals whose antecedents echo a previous utterance.},

@phdthesis{Ozyildiz:21,
	abstract = {This dissertation focuses on what it means to think that or to think whether something is the case. First, I show that the type of clause that think combines with makes a difference in the kind of attitude a thought report ascribes, and in the kind of eventuality that it describes. With a declarative complement, think entails belief and introduces an eventuality description that may (but need not be) stative. With a question complement, think introduces an eventuality description that is necessarily dynamic, and often deliberative. In this case, there is no entailment of belief, but one of agnosticism and curiosity about the answer to the embedded question. This, and a second generalization that governs the attitude related and the aspectual properties of think that and of think whether hold cross-linguistically. 
Second, I attempt to square the observation that think whether is grammatical and necessarily dynamic with two recent proposals that predict that think should be ungrammatical with embedded questions (Mayr, 2019; Theiler et al., 2019). As these go, the excluded middle presupposition, which is associated with think to derive neg(ative)-raising with declaratives, gives rise to an anomalous meaning with embedded questions, which is perceived as ungrammaticality. I argue that question embedding and neg-raising do exclude each other, pace White (accepted), but that this is because the former requires think to introduce a dynamic description, and the latter requires a stative one (Xiang, 2013; Bervoets, 2014, 2020). I stress that think whether is often unacceptable in the sentence frames in which we have been trying to observe it---for example, with the verb in the present simple---but argue that such restrictions are reducible for the most part to interpretive restrictions on dynamic predicates in those frames. 
Third, we need to derive the attitude related and the aspectual alternations that think gives rise to with declarative and question complements. I propose that think's attitude component encodes the entertain modality from inquisitive semantics (Ciardelli and Roelofsen, 2015, a.o.), which is equivalent to belief in the declarative case and compatible with an inquisitive attitude in the quesvi tion case. Turning to the aspectual alternation, I propose to structure attitude eventualities with embedded clause denotations by relating subeventualities of the former and the alternatives provided by the latter. Declaratives provide a single alternative, which makes it possible to construct a divisive (hence stative) predicate. Questions, on the other hand, provide multiple alternatives, which forces think whether to introduce a non-divisive (hence non-stative) predicate. 
Finally, I sketch out some ways in which attitude predicates vary in terms of their attitude related and lexical aspectual properties. I ask whether believe that and believe wh- could be given a treatment similar to think. I point out that there are predicates like know, remember and agree that may or must remain stative in question embedding, and speculate whether presupposing truth or belief might be enabling this option. I end with a typology of predicates that should all be possible if the stative/dynamic alternation seen for think were free, observe that many are missing and characterize the ones that are.},

I propose that inquisitive logical triviality is a source of systematic unacceptability of sentences, to the eect that sentences exhibiting this form of triviality are ungrammatical. I argue that this assumption allows us to explain various empirical puzzles involving indenite and interrogative pronouns.

These contradictions constitute one of the best-known objections to the classical truth-functional account of indicative conditionals. 
In this thesis we give an Inquisitive Semantic account of the Paradoxes of Material Implication. We focus on the sixteen paradoxical inferences that can be found in the literature. We formalize, motivate and discuss two inquisitive systems: Basic Inquisitive Semantics and Radical Inquisitive Semantics. Further, we compare the Basic Inquisitive Semantic and the Radical Inquisitive Semantic account of the Paradoxes of Material Implication with the accounts given by Lewis' Strict Conditional Logic S2, Stalnaker's Conditional Logic C2, Update Semantics and Relevance Logic B. We also discuss the extent to which the inquisitive account of implication reflects the philosophical underpinnings of different non-classical accounts. 
We demonstrate that Radical Inquisitive Semantics is the only system that allows us to account for all of the Paradoxes of Material Implication. We conclude that the account given by Inquisitive Semantics is better than the classical account and has certain advantages over other systems. Finally, we also suggest and discuss several possibilities for further research.},

	abstract = {This thesis explores how a well-founded and uniform compositional account can be given of coordinated questions. First, the empirical picture of question coordination is explored by making a direct comparison between conjunctive, disjunctive, and polar questions. Some surprising observations are discussed, which show that conjunctive questions always correspond to conjunctions of polar questions (PolQs), while disjunctive questions can never be analyzed as disjunctions of PolQs. The proposed account allows us to express several different readings of disjunctive questions, thereby deriving the differences between those readings from the interplay between their intonation, discourse effects, and underlying syntactic structure. In particular, it is argued that the contribution of the question operator should be split up into two components: a component that introduces a presupposition and a component that deals with the at issue question meaning. The way these two components interact is taken to be the crucial difference between PolQs and AltQs. The difference between AltQs and conjunctive questions is explained by making reference to their effects on discourse.},

	abstract = {This thesis is about the semantics of embedded questions and question-embedding verbs. In particular, we focus on so-called responsive verbs, i.e. verbs that can embed both declarative and interrogative complements (Lahiri, 2002). Among these verbs, the classes of emotive factives (such as surprise) and epistemic factives (such as realise) have been extensively studied in the literature, as the verbs belonging to these classes exhibit interesting properties that pose a challenge to the classic semantic approaches to embedded questions. In particular, we focus on the so-called whether-puzzle, i.e. the fact that these verbs fail to embed polar and alternative questions, while they can felicitously embed wh-questions. In the first chapter of the thesis we lay out the theoretical background and the empirical scope of the thesis. In particular, we briefly recall the classic approaches to (embedded) questions by Hamblin (1973), Karttunen (1977) and Groenendijk and Stokhof (1984) and we extensively summarise a body of recent works concerning the semantics and pragmatics of surprise and realise. In the second chapter we present a novel approach to the semantics of responsive verbs and the complements they embed, focusing on know, surprise and realise and showing how to account for the whether-puzzle. Our account crucially relies on the adoption of an additional dimension of sentential meaning aimed to capture the anaphoric potential of a sentence, which is introduced and independently motivated in the first part of the chapter, following the work by Roelofsen and Farkas (forthcoming). In the second part, we develop a semantic system in which the meaning of a complement is spelled out in terms of its semantic content and its anaphoric potential and we introduce our lexical entries for surprise and realise, showing how the interplay between these entries and the semantic analysis of complements can solve the whether-puzzle.},

	abstract = {In Dynamic Epistemic Logic, action models are used to encode situations in which agents are uncertain about information being exchanged. These models show how publicly or privately announced statements can bring about change in knowledge. In real communication, questions also play a big part. Asking a question can raise an issue, which typically triggers the recipient to resolve it. Therefore, adding questions and issues to action models makes them more suitable as models of communication.
In this thesis, we merge the ideas of Inquisitive Epistemic Logic (IEL) and Action Model Logic (AML) in three different ways. This results in three systems, which can encode the exchange of statements and questions and compute their effects on knowledge and issues. Each of these systems can be regarded as a conservative extension of both AML and IEL, and is provided with a sound and complete axiomatization.},

	abstract={Since Kripke, philosophers have distinguished a priori true statements from necessarily true ones. A statement is a priori true if its truth can be established before experience, and necessarily true if it could not have been false according to logical or metaphysical laws. This distinction can be captured formally using two-dimensional semantics.
There is a natural way to extend the notions of apriority and necessity so they can also apply to questions. Questions either can or cannot be resolved before experience, and either are or are not about necessary facts. Classical two-dimensionalism has no account of question meanings, so it has to be combined with a framework for question semantics in order to capture these observations. It is shown in [14] how two-dimensional semantics can be combined with inquisitive semantics, in which questions are analyzed in terms of information. The present paper investigates the logic of two-dimensional inquisitive semantics, and provides a complete proof system.},

@phdthesis{Balogh:09,
	abstract = {In this dissertation I proposed a new, context-based analysis of focusing in the framework of Inquisitive Semantics (2008). The logical system of Groenendijk's framework is introduced for modeling dialogues and motivated by this aim it is defined in such a way that it can handle both questions and assertions in a uniform way. In the syntax of inquisitive logic there is no separate category for questions. Questions are defined in terms of disjunction which is motivated by certain similarities observed in natural language examples. As Grice (1975) already pointed out, the natural language 'or' is mostly used to introduce two alternatives of whom the speaker considers one to be true, but does not know which one. With this alternative interpretation disjunctions turn out to be inquisitive. In chapter 2 I introduced the framework of Inquisitive Semantics in detail. De Inquisitieve Semantiek is tevens uitgerust met een systeem voor dialoog management dat is ontwikkeld met het doel om samenhangende dialogen tussen co{\"o}peratieve deelnemers te modelleren. Dialoogzetten worden aangestuurd door dialoogprincipes die zijn ingegeven door de volgende regels van de griceaanse pragmatiek. The language of Inquisitive Semantics is provided with a dialogue management system that is developed in order to model coherent dialogues between co-operative agents. The dialogue moves are driven by the dialogue principles that are motivated by the main lines of gricean pragmatics. 

The core of the dissertation can be found in chapters 3 to 5, where I propose a new, context-bases analysis of focus, applying and extending the system of Inquisitive Semantics. In order to provide an adequate theory of focusing I provide an analysis for the phenomena of question-answer relation: the notion of congruence, exhaustification of answers; and the focus sensitive particle 'only'. The kernel of my analysis is the claim that the focus structure of the utterance leads to a special theme/rheme division.  The theme of a focused sentence is an inherent question, that is determined by the placement of focus.  I claim that the intonation pattern of the sentence determines the way of division and determines the theme that has an important role in our semantics. The theme of the focused utterance has a strong link to the actual context, that is determined by the focus requirement as the theme of a focused sentence must be compliant to the actual common ground. I also introduced the recent issues of the exhaustive interpretation of answers. I provided an analysis where the exhaustive interpretation of a focused answer is due to a pragmatic inference that is technically carried out by the secondary uptake of the utterance, the pragmatic operation of 'exhaustification'. My main claim is that the focus sensitive particle 'only' introduces a special issue in addition which corresponds to the expectation of more individuals having the given property (Zeevat 2008; Balogh 2005). I capture this idea by the division of an 'only'-sentence that leads to a theme as the question 'are there more?', and the rheme as the exhaustive statement. In my proposal 'only' corresponds to the semantic operator that takes the theme/ rheme division of the focused utterance it modifies. 

After having proposed my approach of focus, in chapter 6 I investigated the interpretation of Hungarian structural focus with special attention to the a well known phenomenon that this structural focus is interpreted exhaustively. The pre-verbal focus position in Hungarian is widely claimed to be associated with an exhaustive/identificational semantic interpretation. I suggest a different analysis, and claim that we can apply the analysis of the exhaustive interpretation via a pragmatic inference similarly as proposed for English focusing. Nevertheless, there is a crucial difference that in Hungarian, in case focusing is not triggered by other linguistic devices (contrastive topic, stress avoiding verb etc.) then focusing signals an obligatory implicature of exclusiveness that cannot be cancelled.},

@phdthesis{Anderbois:11,
	abstract = {The central topic this dissertation is the semantic relationship between disjunctions, indefinites, and other instances of existential quantification on the one hand and questions on the other. I argue that the former have more in common with the latter than is generally acknowledged and, in particular, that their compositional semantics includes not only truth-conditional information, but also an issue-raising or inquisitive capacity. For example, a simple assertion like ``Someone left.'' not only proposes to rule out the possibility that no one left, it also presents the issue of `Who left?' as a possible direction for future discussion. 

This dissertation presents several empirical arguments for this inquisitive capacity and for particular interactions with other elements in the sentence. The most direct argument comes from novel fieldwork on wh- and alternative questions in Yucatec Maya (an indigenous language of Mexico), which consist of focused disjunctions and focused indefinite wh-words respectively. I argue that both patterns can be accounted for under a semantics where disjunctions and indefinite wh-words --- across all their uses --- make a contribution that is both inquisitive and potentially informative. The (contextually restricted) presupposition of focus is responsible for isolating this inquisitive capacity in questions, thus distinguishing them from assertions. 

This Yucatec Maya-based semantics for disjunctions and indefinites sheds light on several puzzles regarding these elements more generally, and in particular, in English. The first of these is the ellipsis process known as Sluicing, which I analyze as the anaphoric retrieval of an issue introduced by prior inquisitive elements. Second, I provide an analysis of subtle differences between positive, negative, and alternative polar questions with or not, which makes use of a more structured `two-tiered' semantics for issues. Finally, I provide a semantic/pragmatic account of polar questions with preposed negation in which (double) negation plays the pivotal semantic role, suppressing inquisitive content within the question itself, thereby providing added emphasis on the truth-conditional information of the proposition itself (i.e. Verum Focus).},

In this paper, I look at two such items in Egyptian Arabic---wallaa and aw---that conform to Haspelmath's descriptions of interrogative and standard disjunctions, respectively. Using Inquisitive Semantics (Ciardelli et al.

Virtema (2015, 2019) provided a Goldblatt-Thomason-style characterization for (extended) modal dependence logic with the help of a normal form result for the logic.
A key ingredient of establishing the characterization was to show that the ordinary
modal logic expanded with positive occurrences of the universal modality and extended modal dependence logic have the same definability over Kripke models. This
paper first reviews Goldblatt-Thomason-style characterization for intuitionistic logic
from Rodenburg (1986)’s work on intuitionistic correspondence theory. Then we
employ a similar strategy to Sano and Virtema (2015, 2019) and provide a GoldblattThomason-style characterization for intuitionistic inquisitive logic.},

B, we define its inquisitive extension H(B) and prove that H(B) is
the unique inquisitive algebra having B as its algebra of double negation fixpoints.
We also show that inquisitive algebras determine Medvedev’s logic of
finite problems. In addition to the algebraic characterization of H(B),
we give a topological characterization of H(B) in terms of the recently
introduced choice-free duality for Boolean algebras using so-called upper
Vietoris spaces (UV-spaces). In particular, while a Boolean algebra
B is realized as the Boolean algebra of compact regular open elements
of a UV-space dual to B, we show that H(B) is realized as the algebra
of compact open elements of this space. This connection yields a new

	abstract = {This paper develops a logic that combines the main features of dynamic epistemic logic with those of inquisitive semantics. We argue that this merge helps both traditions a step further. From the viewpoint of dynamic epistemic logic, the main benefit lies in the fact that inquisitiveness does not only enter the picture at the level of speech acts, but already at the level of semantic content, which means in particular that it becomes possible to deal with embedded questions. From the viewpoint of inquisitive semantics, the main vantage point is that we inherit from dynamic epistemic logic a perspicuous way of representing the epistemic states of the conversational participants, and a way to specify explicitly how utterances and other speech acts affect these epistemic states.},

@unpublished{Hamami:12,
	abstract = {Interrogative inquiry refers to the process of knowledge-seeking by questioning. In this paper, we investigate the process of interrogative inquiry in the context of conversations. To this end, we develop a formalization of interrogative inquiry based on inquisitive semantics and pragmatics. This is motivated by the capacity of inquisitive semantics to provide a semantic account of questions and answers in natural language, and the capacity of inquisitive pragmatics to provide a pragmatic account of the behavior of questions and answers in conversations.

The paper begins with a presentation of the modelling of questions and answers in the inquisitive framework. Then, after a brief comparison of the inquisitive account of questions with Hintikka's treatment of questions in the Interrogative Model of Inquiry (IMI), we discuss and define the notion of interrogative rule which aims to characterize the question-answer steps that one can make in an interrogative inquiry. We then put the interrogative rule into a temporal perspective, by introducing the notion of interrogative protocol, which aims to govern interrogative inquiry as a temporal process. The notion of interrogative protocol enables us to reach formal definitions of the notion of interrogative inquiry and the associated logical notion of interrogative consequence, that we illustrate with some concrete examples. Our framework thus defined allows then for a formal logical and computational study of the process of interrogative inquiry. On the logical side, we relate the notion of interrogative consequence with the ones of distributed information and yes-no question. On the computational side, we shape the bases of a computational investigation of interrogative inquiry in our framework, and we present first computational results. From this computational perspective, we propose to revisit the so-called strategic aspects of inquiry, one of the main themes of Hintikka's IMI, from an algorithmic point of view. We end this paper with some concluding remarks and suggestions for further works.},

We characterise maximal and minimal intermediate logics with the same negative variant, and we prove a suitable version of Tarski's and Birkhoff's classic variety theorems. We also introduce finite DNA-varieties and show that these varieties are axiomatised by the analogues of Jankov formulas. Finally, we prove that the lattice of extensions of InqB is dually isomorphic to the ordinal ω + 1 and give an axiomatisation of these logics via Jankov DNA-formulas.

Proof-theoretically, we show that questions may be used in inferences as placeholders for arbitrary information of a given type; by manipulating such placeholders, we may construct formal proofs of dependencies. Finally, we show that such proofs have a specific kind of constructive content: they do not just witness the existence of a certain dependency, but actually encode a method for transforming information of the types described by the assumptions into information of the type described by the conclusion.},

	abstract = {Questions are well-studied in semantics, including from a psycholinguistics perspective. They also play a key role in pragmatics through questions under discussions, which are known to affect a wide range of phenomena (e.g., focus, implicatures) . The pragmatics of questions themselves however is largely understudied, with very few theoretical proposals and only a handful of experimental studies. Pragmatics studies how speakers choose an utterance over possible competitors, and how listeners can draw complex inferences by reconstructing the speaker's reasoning leading to this choice. While we have a good understanding of the factors at play when a speaker utters a declarative sentence, much less is known about questions. The goal of this paper is to test two proposals extending Grice's Maxims to questions: van Rooij's entropy as a measure of question utility, and Groenendijk and Roelofsen's inquisitive pragmatics. The two theories make opposite predictions regarding the choice between polar and wh-questions in ignorance and partial knowledge situations, and therefore the implicatures they give rise to regarding the questioner's knowledge. The results of two experiments corroborate the predictions of van Rooij's proposal. In passing, we establish that the cornering effect of negative alternative questions (Biezma 2009) is independent from their ignorance requirements.},

To explain the fuzzy phenomena in natural languages, this paper extends InqB into the framework of M-fuzzifying setting and establishes a basic system of M-fuzzifying inquisitive semantics. To begin with, the notion of M-fuzzifying supporting mapping is defined, where M is a completely distributive lattice with an involution operator and each subset of the universal set of all possible worlds can be regarded as a support of any well-formed formula to some degree. Then the notions of M-fuzzifying entailment order, M-fuzzifying truth mappings, M-fuzzifying informative content mappings and M-fuzzifying inquisitive content mappings are introduced and their properties are discussed. Further, the degrees of assertiveness, informativeness, inquisitiveness and questioning of a well-formed formula are defined, by which the M-fuzzifying assertive projection operator and the M-fuzzifying questioning projection operator are introduced and characterized. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained, where a well-formed formula is exactly the disjunction of its unique M-fuzzifying assertive projection and unique M-fuzzifying questioning projection.},

We consider the basic system InqB of INQ, remain at the propositional level and show, inter alia, that: (1) a disjunction of all the direct answers to an evoked question is always inquisitive; (2) a formula is inquisitive if, and only if it evokes a yes--no question whose affirmative answer expresses a possibility for the formula; (3) inquisitive formulas evoke questions whose direct answers express all the possibilities for the formulas, and (4) each question erotetically implies a question whose direct answers express the possibilities for the direct answers to the implying question.},

@article{Westera:17sub,
	abstract = {A well-known challenge for accounts of exhaustivity implications is the granularity problem: that adding a non-weakest disjunct to an utterance (e.g., ``or both'') may prevent exhaustivity implications. Recent approaches to this problem apply exhaustivity operators either globally, i.e., to the disjunction as a whole, or locally, i.e., to each disjunct separately. This paper seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the operators employed in the globalist strand, which, contrary to globalists' aims, have not thus far been given any sort of pragmatic motivation. To that end this paper demonstrates that these operators can be derived, wholly or in part, from a pragmatic theory: Attentional Pragmatics (Westera, 2017). The theory centers on the assumption that speakers should not only assert all relevant propositions they hold true, but also draw attention to all relevant propositions they consider possible. This assumption, suitably formalized, overcomes the granularity problem. The current paper formally derives an exhaustivity operator from Attentional Pragmatics and proves that it is in important respects conservative with regard to existing operators.},

I show that if a richer notion of meaning is adopted, in particular that of attentive semantics (Roelofsen, 2011), this Maxim of Relation automatically becomes strong enough to enable exhaustivity implicatures. The results suggest that pragmatic reasoning is sensitive not only to the information an utterance provides, but also to the possibilities it draws attention to.

It has recently been suggested that these selectional properties are at least partly semantic in nature. In particular, it is proposed that the anti-rogativity of neg-raising predicates like believe comes from the triviality in meaning that would arise with interrogative complements.

In so doing we also aim at explaining the fact that their veridical counterparts such as be happy are responsive.},

Do these have a unified semantics, or do they merely bear a family resemblance? Are they aided by silent operators in their varied roles―if yes, what operators? I dub the particles ``quantifier particles'' and refer to them generically with capitalized versions of the Japanese morphemes. I argue that both MO and KA can be assigned a stable semantics across their various roles. The specific analysis I offer is motivated by the fact that MO and KA often combine with just one argument; I propose that this is their characteristic behavior. Their role is to impose semantic requirements that are satisfied when the immediately larger context is interpreted as the meet/join of their host's semantic contribution with something else. They do not perform meet/join themselves. The obligatory vs. optional appearance of the particles depends on whether the meet/join interpretations arise by default in the given constellation.

Substructural inquisitive logics are logics of questions based on substructural logics of declarative sentences. They generalize basic inquisitive logic which is based on the classical logic of declaratives. We show that if the underlying substructural logic is distributive, the generalization can be extended to embrace also the epistemic modalities `knowing whether' and `wondering whether' that are applicable to questions. We construct a semantic framework for a language of propositional substructural logics enriched with a question-forming operator (inquisitive disjunction) and epistemic modalities. We show that within this framework, one can define a canonical model with suitable properties for any (syntactically defined) epistemic inquisitive logic. This leads to a general approach to completeness proofs for such logics. A deductive system for the weakest epistemic inquisitive logic is described and completeness proved for this special case using the general method.},

It is based on algebraic structures that are interpreted as algebras of information states. The proposed semantics combines into one framework various features of standard relational and algebraic semantics. Especially, the connection to the algebraic semantics is explored in detail.

The result of this combination is a logical system (InqPDL) that conservatively extends both PDL and InqB, and, moreover, allows for an interaction of the question-forming operator from InqB with the structured modalities from PDL. We study this system from a semantic as well as a syntactic point of view. These two perspectives are linked via a completeness proof, which also shows that InqPDL is decidable.

It is argued that these structures are suitable for algebraic semantics of inquisitive superintuitionistic logics, i.e. logics of questions based on intuitionistic logic and its extensions. We explain how questions are represented in these structures (prime elements represent declarative propositions, non-prime elements represent questions, join is a question-forming operation) and provide several alternative characterizations of these algebras. For instance, it is shown that a Heyting algebra is inquisitive if and only if its prime filters and filters generated by sets of prime elements coincide and prime elements are closed under relative pseudocomplement. We prove that the weakest inquisitive superintuitionistic logic is sound with respect to a Heyting algebra iff the algebra is what we call a homomorphic p-image of some inquisitive Heyting algebra. It is also shown that a logic is inquisitive iff its Lindenbaum--Tarski algebra is an inquisitive Heyting algebra.},

Two alternative semantic conditions for disjunction are compared: the first one corresponds to the so-called tensor operator of dependence logic, and the second one is the standard condition for inquisitive disjunction. It is shown that GIS is intimately related to intuitionistic logic and its Kripke semantics. Using this framework, it is shown that the main results concerning inquisitive semantics, especially the axiomatization of inquisitive logic, can be viewed as particular cases of more general phenomena.

The main result of this paper is a theorem establishing the completeness of the system with respect to inquisitive semantics with weak negation.

To this end, inquisitive propositional logic extends classical propositional logic for declarative sentences with principles governing a new binary connective of inquisitive disjunction, which allows the formation of questions. Recently inquisitive logicians have considered what happens if the logic of declarative sentences is assumed to be intuitionistic rather than classical. In short, what should inquisitive logic be on an intuitionistic base? In this paper, we provide an answer to this question from the perspective of nuclear semantics, an approach to classical and intuitionistic semantics pursued in our previous work. In particular, we show how Beth semantics for intuitionistic logic naturally extends to a semantics for inquisitive intuitionistic logic. In addition, we show how an explicit view of inquisitive intuitionistic logic comes via a translation into propositional lax logic, whose completeness we prove with respect to Beth semantics.},

The two are labelled assertive rising declaratives and inquisitive rising declaratives, respectively. Guided by the experimental results, the paper develops a semantic analysis of them. Having as backdrop an extended Lewisian model of discourse involving a conversational scoreboard, the analysis associates assertive and inquisitive rising declaratives with distinct sets of context-changing conventions that bring about fundamentally different updates to core elements of the context. In the process, it highlights their respective partial overlaps with the conventions for two other sentence types, falling declaratives and polar interrogatives. The analysis fully captures the experimental results presented in the paper and reconciles disparate, seemingly contradictory observations about English rising declaratives noted in previous work.},

@article{Hamami:14,
	abstract = {Conversation is one of the main contexts in which we are conducting inquiries. Yet, little attention has been paid so far in pragmatics or epistemology to the process of inquiry in conversation. In this paper, we propose to trigger such an investigation through the development of a formal modelling based on inquisitive pragmatics --- a framework offering a semantic representation of questions and answers, along with an analysis of the pragmatic principles that govern questioning and answering moves in conversations geared towards information exchange. Our starting observation is that an interrogative inquiry in a conversation takes the form of a finite sequence of questioning and answering steps, and appears thereby as an inherently temporal process. The central notion of interrogative protocol introduced in this paper precisely aims to capture the temporal dimension of inquiry. Interrogative protocols are defined as branching-time tree structures encoding all the possible sequences of questioning and answering steps --- i.e., all the possible inquiry paths --- that can subsequently occur in a starting conversational situation in accordance with the principles of inquisitive pragmatics. They provide us with a formal environment to define and investigate the epistemological notions of interrogative inquiry and interrogative consequence in conversational contexts. One of the main interests of the resulting framework is to enable a formal investigation of central epistemological issues relative to interrogative inquiry under the form of computational problems. We frame three key inquiry problems along this line, and we then propose an algorithmic procedure for solving them in the restricted case where the inquirer has at her disposal a finite number of questions in her inquiry. We conclude by relating our approach to Wi{\'s}niewski's Erotetic Search Scenarios and Hintikka's Interrogative Model of Inquiry.},

	abstract = {We start out postulating a notion of an erotetic language as a language that covers both informative and inquisitive semantic content. Next we postulate the concept of a classical erotetic language, where it is required that informative and inquisitive content are divided over two distinct syntactic categories: indicatives and interrogatives. From the general notion of an erotetic language we derive the fundamental logical-semantical concepts of inquisitive semantics, and sketch the contours of such a semantics for propositional erotetic languages. Then we first fill in the semantic details to arrive at a general inquisitive semantics for propositional erotetic languages. Next we restrict the syntax of the language in such a way that it becomes a classical erotetic language. The syntactic restrictions make this classical language semantically essentially poorer than the general one, though it is still richer than classical partition semantics, and can cope with conditional questions. The notion of the inquisitive hierarchy mentioned in the title of the paper plays a crucial role in explaining the difference. However, we go on to show that, while sticking to a classical erotetic language, the semantic restrictions can be lifted by generalizing interrogative formation from an operation on single sentences to one on sets of sentences. As a result, like non-classical general inquisitive semantics, classical inquisitive semantics can cope with alternative questions, and the general and the extended classical language turn out to be basically equivalent in expressiveness. They only differ in that in the classical case we sometimes need two sentences to express what in a general erotetic language can be expressed by a single sentence. For all systems under discussion, we show that they are conservative extensions of classical logic.},

	abstract={Logics based on team semantics, such as inquisitive logic and dependence logic, are not closed under uniform substitution. This leads to an interesting separation between expressive power and definability: it may be that an operator O can be added to a language without a gain in expressive power, yet O is not definable in that language. For instance, even though propositional inquisitive logic and propositional dependence logic have the same expressive power, inquisitive disjunction and implication are not definable in propositional dependence logic. A question that has been open for some time in this area is whether the tensor disjunction used in propositional dependence logic is definable in inquisitive logic. We settle this question in the negative. In fact, we show that extending the logical repertoire of inquisitive logic by means of tensor disjunction leads to an independent set of connectives; that is, no connective in the resulting logic is definable in terms of the others.},

	abstract={According to one form of epistemic contrastivism, due to Jonathan Schaffer, knowledge is not a binary relation between an agent and a proposition, but a ternary relation between an agent, a proposition, and a context-basing question. In a slogan: to know is to know the answer to a question. I argue, first, that Schaffer-style epistemic contrastivism can be semantically represented in inquisitive dynamic epistemic logic, a recent implementation of inquisitive semantics in the framework of dynamic epistemic logic; second, that within inquisitive dynamic epistemic logic, the contrastive ternary knowledge operator is reducible to the standard binary one. The reduction shows, I argue, that Schaffer’s argument in favor of contrastivism is compatible with a binary picture of knowledge. This undercuts the force of the argument in favor of contrastivism.},

	abstract = {Information exchange can be viewed as a process of asking questions and answering them. While dynamic epistemic logic traditionally focuses on statements, recent developments have been concerned with ways of incorporating questions. One approach, based on the framework of inquisitive semantics, is inquisitive dynamic epistemic logic (𝖨𝖣𝖤𝖫). In this system, agents are represented with issues as well as information. On the dynamic level, it can model actions that raise new issues. Compared to other approaches, a limitation of 𝖨𝖣𝖤𝖫 is that it can only encode public announcements. 𝖨𝖣𝖤𝖫 can be refined to encode private questions, by merging its static basis, inquisitive epistemic logic (𝖨𝖤𝖫), with action model logic (𝖠𝖬𝖫). This can be done in two ways, namely by enriching action models with questions as possible actions or with issues concerning which action takes place. This paper describes the corresponding dynamic logics, which are conservative extensions of both 𝖠𝖬𝖫 and 𝖨𝖤𝖫, and a sound and complete axiomatization is given for both.},

Rogative predicates like wonder are only compatible with interrogative complements, while responsive predicates like know are also compatible with declarative complements. There are two main theories of responsive predicates: The question-to-proposition reduction approach holds that responsive predicates semantically always select for propositions and that both declarative and interrogative complements to them denote propositions (Heim 1994; Dayal 1996; Lahiri 2002; Spector & Egr{\'e} 2015). The proposition-to-question reduction approach (Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984; Theiler et al. 2015; Uegaki 2015) assumes that responsive predicates semantically always select for question denotations and declarative complements denote resolved questions. We argue that Predicates of Relevance (PoRs) favour the latter approach.},

But the standard view gives us no way to model interventions involving expressions that only have an attentional effects on conversational contexts. How are expressions with non-informational content -- like epistemic modals -- used to intervene in rational decision making? We show how to model rational decision change without information change: replace a standard conception of value (on which the value of a set of worlds reduces to values of individual worlds in the set) with one on which the value of a set of worlds is determined by a selection function that picks out a generic member world. We discuss some upshots of this view for theorizing in philosophy and formal semantics.},

@article{Cremers:18,
	abstract = {Questions embedded under responsive predicates and definite descriptions both give rise to a variety of phenomena which can be grouped under the term plurality effects: quantificational variability, cumulativity, and homogeneity effects. This similarity has not gone unnoticed, and many proposals have taken inspiration in theories of definite plurals to account for these effects with embedded questions (Dayal in Locality in WH quantification: questions and relative clauses in Hindi, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1996; Lahiri in Questions and answers in embedded contexts, Oxford studies in theoretical linguistics 2, Oxford University Press, New York, 2002; a.o.). Recently these phenomena have received less attention, as the field has focused on the so-called intermediate exhaustive reading of embedded questions instead, after Spector (Exhaustive interpretations: what to say and what not to say, Presentation at LSA Workshop: `Context and Content', 2005) called into question the traditional dichotomy between weak and strong exhaustive readings. As a result, the intermediate exhaustive reading has been accounted for at the expense of empirical coverage in other areas. In this paper, I propose a modular theory which derives the currently much discussed exhaustive readings without giving up the rich semantics necessary to account for plurality effects. My account of quantificational variability, cumulativity, and homogeneity effects builds on recent work on these phenomena in the nominal domain by adopting a categorial approach to embedded questions, while the strong and intermediate exhaustive readings are implemented using an independent strengthening mechanism suggested in Klinedinst and Rothschild (Semant Pragmat 4(2):1--23, 2011). The resulting theory not only recovers important results on plurality effects; it offers new, simple solutions for some puzzles presented in George (Question embedding and the semantics of answers, Ph.D. dissertation, UCLA, 2011; Thought J Philos 2(2):166--177, 2013) and Paill{\'e} and Schwarz (in: Stockwell (ed) Proceedings of WCCFL 36, vol 36, Cascadilla Proceedings Project, Somerville, 2018), naturally derives readings that had been postulated in previous literature (Preuss in Issues in the semantics of questions with quantifiers, Ph.D. dissertation, Rutgers University, 2001), makes correct predictions in many unexplored cases, and is compatible with recent results in psycholinguistics. In the last sections I justify my assumptions and show how possible limitations I inherit from the theories I build on can be accommodated under standard assumptions.},

First, in a scenario with N objects of a given type, speakers consistently judge it true that there are 'at least N' and 'at most N' objects of that type. This supports the debated position that the ignorance conveyed by superlative modifiers is an implicature, not an entailment, and contrasts with results obtained using an inference-judgment paradigm, suggesting that truth-value judgment tasks are impervious to certain pragmatic infelicities that inference-judgment tasks are sensitive to. The second finding is not predicted by any previous theory: In a scenario with N objects, it is not consistently judged true that there are 'at most N + 1' objects, even though it is consistently judged true that there are 'at least N -- 1' objects. To explain this, we propose a novel pragmatic principle requiring that the scenario depicted by a sentence must be considered possible by the speaker (the Maxim of Depictive Sincerity). Put together, the two findings show that truth-value judgment tasks are impervious to some aspects of pragmatics, but not all.},

First, we show that two truth-conditionally equivalent clauses can make different semantic contributions when embedded in a counterfactual antecedent. Assuming compositionality, this means that the meaning of these clauses is not fully determined by their truth conditions. This finding has a clear explanation in inquisitive semantics: truth-conditionally equivalent clauses may be associated with different propositional alternatives, each of which counts as a separate counterfactual assumption. Second, we show that our results contradict the common idea that the interpretation of a counterfactual involves minimizing change with respect to the actual state of affairs. We propose to replace the idea of minimal change by a distinction between foreground and background for a given counterfactual assumption: the background is held fixed in the counterfactual situation, while the foreground can be varied without any minimality constraint.},

We introduce and investigate the natural notion of bisimulation equivalence in the setting of InqML.

In its epistemic incarnation, it extends standard epistemic logic to capture not just the information that agents have, but also the questions that they are interested in. Technically, INQML fits within the family of logics based on team semantics. From a model-theoretic perspective, it takes us a step in the direction of monadic second-order logic, as inquisitive modal operators involve quantification over sets of worlds. We introduce and investigate the natural notion of bisimulation equivalence in the setting of INQML. We compare the expressiveness of INQML and first-order logic in the context of relational structures with two sorts, one for worlds and one for information states, and characterise inquisitive modal logic as the bisimulation invariant fragment of first-order logic over various natural classes of two-sorted structures.},

	abstract = {Inquisitive dynamic epistemic logic (IDEL) extends public announcement logic incorporating ideas from inquisitive semantics. In IDEL, the standard public announcement action can be extended to a more general public utterance action, which may involve a statement or a question. While uttering a statement has the effect of a standard announcement, uttering a question typically leads to new issues being raised. In this paper, we investigate the logic of this general public utterance action. We find striking commonalities, and some differences, with public announcement logic. We show that dynamic modalities admit a set of reduction axioms, which allow us to turn any formula of IDEL into an equivalent formula of static inquisitive epistemic logic. This leads us to establish several complete axiomatizations of IDEL, corresponding to known axiomatizations of public announcement logic.},

@inproceedings{Ciardelli:14aiml,
	abstract = {Building on ideas from inquisitive semantics, the recently proposed framework of inquisitive epistemic logic (IEL) provides the tools to model and reason about scenarios in which agents do not only have information, but also entertain issues. This framework has been shown to allow for a generalization to issues of important notions, such as common knowledge and public announcements, and it has been argued to form a suitable basis for the analysis of information exchange as an interactive process of raising and resolving issues. From an abstract point of view, the system is interesting, in that it implies extending the logical operations, including the modalities, beyond the truth-conditional realm, in such a way that they can embed not only standard declarative formulas, but also interrogatives. The present paper investigates the logic of IEL, building up to a completeness result. It is shown that the standard logical features of the logical constants extend smoothly beyond the truth-conditional realm, except for double negation, which is the hallmark of truth-conditionality. In particular, while the modalities of IEL operate in a crucially richer semantic space than Kripke modalities do, they retain entirely standard logical features.},

The dependence statement is true or false at a world w according to whether, relative
to the set of successors of w, every answer to the former yields an answer to the latter.
This motivates an investigation of strict conditionals in the context of inquisitive logic.
A sound and complete axiomatization of the resulting logic is established, both for
the class of all Kripke frames, and for various notable frame classes.},

	abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to investigate the relation between the meaning of a sentence and its truth conditions. We report on a comprehension experiment on counterfactual conditionals, based on a context in which a light is controlled by two switches. Our main finding is that the truth-conditionally equivalent clauses (i) switch A or switch B is down and (ii) switch A and switch B are not both up make different semantic contributions when embedded in a conditional antecedent. Assuming compositionality, this means that (i) and (ii) differ in meaning, which implies that the meaning of a sentential clause cannot be identified with its truth conditions. We show that our data have a clear explanation in inquisitive semantics: in a conditional antecedent, (i) introduces two distinct assumptions, while (ii) introduces only one. Independently of the complications stemming from disjunctive antecedents, our results also challenge analyses of counterfactuals in terms of minimal change from the actual state of affairs: we show that such analyses cannot account for our findings, regardless of what changes are considered minimal.},

	abstract = {Crosslinguistically, questions frequently make crucial use of morphosyntactic elements which also occur outside of questions. Chief among these are focus, disjunctions, and wh-words with indefinite semantics. This paper provides a compositional account of the semantics of wh-, alternative, and polar questions in Yucatec Maya (YM), which are composed primarily of these elements. Key to the account is a theory of disjunctions and indefinites (extending work by others) which recognizes the inherently inquisitive nature of these elements. While disjunctions and indefinites are inquisitive, they differ from questions since they are also truth-conditionally informative. Compositionally, then, the role of focus in YM questions is to presuppose the informative component of an indefinite wh-word or disjunction, rendering the inquisitive component the question's only new contribution to the discourse. In addition to deriving question denotations compositionally, the account also captures a potentially surprising fact: focused disjunctions in YM can function as either questions or assertions, depending solely on the discourse context.},

The approach is driven by empirical data from legal discourse and does not suffer from the same problems as implicature-based accounts. Following Anderson's violation-based deontic logic, we will demonstrate that a support-based radical inquisitive semantics will correctly model both the free choice effect and the standard disjunctive behaviour when disjunctive permission is embedded under negation. An inquisitive semantics also models the case when disjunctive permission is continued with ``but I do not know which'' which coerces an ignorance reading. We also demonstrate that a principled approach to negation provides a monotonic but restricted definition of entailment, which solves the problem of strengthening with a conjunct that is used as a counterargument against violation-based accounts.},

The authors then sketch a way to account for the data within the feature model, as well as a revised version of the saliency account.

The first goal of this paper is to work out in full detail an account of the new German data in the feature model. In the process, we will clarify and better articulate those aspects of the feature model that are responsible for how preference patterns are to be explained. Our second goal is to deepen the comparison between this model and the saliency approach by taking a wider cross-linguistic perspective.},

@incollection{Roelofsen:19OER,
	abstract = {This survey article discusses two basic issues that semantic theories of questions face. The first is how to conceptualize and formally represent the semantic content of questions. This issue arises in particular because the standard truth-conditional notion of meaning, which has been fruitful in the analysis of declarative statements, is not applicable to questions. This is because questions are not naturally construed as being true or false. Instead, it has been proposed that the semantic content of a question must be characterized in terms of its answerhood or resolution conditions. This article surveys a number of theories which develop this basic idea in different ways, focusing on so-called proposition-set theories (alternative semantics, partition semantics, and inquisitive semantics).

The second issue that will be considered here concerns questions that are embedded within larger sentences. Within this domain, one important puzzle is why certain predicates can take both declarative and interrogative complements (e.g., Bill knows that Mary called / Bill knows who called), while others take only declarative complements (e.g., Bill thinks that Mary called / *Bill thinks who called) or only interrogative complements (e.g., Bill wonders who called / *Bill wonders that Mary called). We compare two general approaches that have been pursued in the literature. One assumes that declarative and interrogative complements differ in semantic type. On this approach, the fact that predicates like think do not take interrogative complements can be accounted for by assuming that such complements do not have the semantic type that think selects for. The other approach treats the two kinds of complement as having the same semantic type, and seeks to connect the selectional restrictions of predicates like think to other semantic properties (e.g., the fact that think is neg-raising).},

@book{Ciardelli:18book,
	abstract = {This book presents a new logical framework to capture the meaning of sentences in conversation. The traditional approach equates meaning with truth-conditions: to know the meaning of a sentence is to know under which circumstances it is true. The reason for this is that linguistic and philosophical investigations are usually carried out in a logical framework that was originally designed to characterize valid argumentation. However, argumentation is neither the sole, nor the primary function of language. One task that language more widely and ordinarily fulfils is to enable the exchange of information between conversational participants. In the framework outlined in this volume, inquisitive semantics, information exchange is seen as a process of raising and resolving issues. Inquisitive semantics provides a new formal notion of meaning, which makes it possible to model various concepts that are crucial for the analysis of linguistic information exchange in a more refined and more principled way than has been possible in previous frameworks. Importantly, it also allows an integrated treatment of statements and questions.

The first part of the book presents the framework in detail, while the second demonstrates its benefits in the semantic analysis of questions, coordination, modals, conditionals, and intonation. The book will be of interest to researchers and students from advanced undergraduate level upwards in the fields of semantics, pragmatics, philosophy of language, and logic.

This approach avoids a number of problems for non-uniform theories, such as the reductive theories of Karttunen (1977), Heim (1994), Lahiri (2002), Spector & Egr{\'e} (2015), among others, and the twin relations theory of George (2011).

This inference has been referred to as a distributive ignorance inference (Roelofsen & Uegaki 2016). We present two experiments examining the distributive ignorance inferences triggered by two verbs, wonder and believe, with different types of complements and different types of quantificational subjects.

The results of these experiments show that the distributive ignorance inferences triggered by the two verbs pattern very much alike. We argue that the data are best explained by an account that involves a strengthening mechanism which is sensitive to the syntactic structure of the complement of the verbs involved and optionally applies locally, as part of the semantic composition process.},

However, several authors have claimed that predicates like be certain can only embed interrogatives in specific environments. According to Mayr, these are exactly the environments that license negative polarity items (NPIs). In his analysis, both NPIs and embedded interrogatives are licensed by the same semantic strengthening procedure. If this is right, one would expect a correlation between acceptability of be certain whether and NPIs. The analysis also predicts a contrast between antecedents vs. consequents of conditionals and restrictors vs. scopes of universal quantifiers. This paper tests these predictions experimentally through an acceptability judgment task. We find that judgments for be certain whether do not correlate with judgments on NPIs, which suggests that be certain whether and NPIs are in fact licensed by different mechanisms.},

In contrast to the recent proposal by Schwarz (2016a), and drawing on elements from Coppock and Brochhagen's (2013) inquisitive analysis, the proposal decouples ignorance implicatures from upper-bounding implicatures, and thereby captures an important difference between more than and at least, which differ in their ignorance implicatures but both lack an upper-bounding implicature. At the same time, it accounts for the context-sensitivity in the ignorance implicatures of modified numerals found by Westera and Brasoveanu (2014), and addresses a problem with Coppock and Brochhagen (2013) pointed out by Schwarz (2016b). The key feature of the proposal is the fact that ignorance implicatures may arise in two different ways, namely, both from the Maxim of Quantity and from the Maxim of Quality.},

The account aims to divide the labor between compositional semantics and conventions of use in a principled way. We argue that falling declaratives and polar interrogatives are unmarked sentence types. On our account, differences in their conventional discourse effects follow from independently motivated semantic differences combined with a single convention of use, which applies uniformly to both sentence types. As a result, the Fregean `illocutionary force operators' Assertion and Question become unnecessary. In contrast, we argue that rising declaratives and tag interrogatives are marked sentence types. On our account, their conventional discourse effects consist of the effects that are dictated by the basic convention of use that is common to all sentence types considered here, augmented with special effects that are systematically connected to their formal properties. Thus, a central feature of our approach is that it maintains a parallelism between unmarked and marked sentence types on the one hand, and basic and complex discourse effects on the other.},

This allows for a more fine-grained view on meaning, which has led to improved analyses of a wide range of linguistic phenomena. However, this approach also faces a number of problems. We focus here on two of these, in our view the most fundamental ones. The first has to do with how meanings are composed, i.e., with the type-theoretic operations of function application and abstraction; the second has to do with how meanings are compared, i.e., the notion of entailment. Our aim is to reconcile what we take to be the essence of Hamblin's proposal with the more orthodox type-theoretic framework rooted in the work of Montague in such a way that both the explanatory utility of the former and the solid formal foundations of the latter are preserved. Our proposal builds on insights from recent work on inquisitive semantics, and it also contributes to the further development of this framework by specifying how the inquisitive meaning of a sentence may be built up compositionally.},

Standard accounts of such verbs are reductive: they assume that whether an individual stands in a knowledge-wh relation to a question is determined by whether she stands in a knowledge-that relation to some answer to the question. George (2013) observed that knowledge-wh, however, not only depends on knowledge-that but also on false belief---a fact that reductive accounts can't capture.

We develop an account that is not reductive but uniform: it assumes a single entry for interrogative-embedding and declarative-embedding uses of a responsive verb. The key insight that allows us to capture the false-belief dependency of knowledge-wh is that verbs like know are sensitive to both true and false answers to the embedded question. Formally, this is achieved through a novel, fine-grained way of representing the meaning of a clausal complement in terms of so-called truthful resolutions. The resulting analysis gives us a unifying perspective, under which false-answer sensitivity comes out as a general characteristic common to all levels of exhaustivity.},

At a dynamic level, IDEL does not only allow us to model the effects of communicative actions that provide new information, like standard DEL, but also the effects of actions that raise new issues. Thus, IDEL provides the fundamental tools needed to analyze information exchange as a dynamic process of raising and resolving issues.},

@inproceedings{CiardelliRoelofsen:16sub,
	abstract = {Hamblin (1973) proposed an extension of the basic type-theoretic framework used in formal
semantics, rooted in Montague (1970, 1973). In Hamblin's framework, which has come to
be referred to as alternative semantics, the meaning of a sentence is not taken to be a single
proposition, but rather a set of propositions---a set of alternatives. This allows for a more
fine-grained view on meaning, which has led to improved analyses of a wide range of linguistic
phenomena. However, it also faces a number of problems. We focus here on two of these, in
our view the most fundamental ones. The first has to do with how meanings are composed,
i.e., with the type-theoretic operations of function application and abstraction; the second has
to do with how meanings are compared, i.e., the notion of entailment. Our aim is to reconcile
what we take to be the essence of Hamblin's proposal with the more orthodox type-theoretic
framework rooted in Montague's work, in such a way that the solid formal foundations of the
latter are preserved and the observed problems for alternative semantics are overcome. Our
proposal builds on insights from recent work on inquisitive semantics (Ciardelli et al., 2013),
and it also further advances this line of work, specifying how the inquisitive meaning of a
sentence, as well as the set of alternatives that it introduces, may be built up compositionally.},

@article{Ciardelli:15inqd,
	abstract = {In many natural languages, there are clear syntactic and/or intonational differences between declarative sentences, which are primarily used to provide information, and interrogative sentences, which are primarily used to request information. Most logical frameworks restrict their attention to the former. Those that are concerned with both usually assume a logical language that makes a clear syntactic distinction between declaratives and interrogatives, and usually assign different types of semantic values to these two types of sentences. A different approach has been taken in recent work on inquisitive semantics. This approach does not take the basic syntactic distinction between declaratives and interrogatives as its starting point, but rather a new notion of meaning that captures both informative and inquisitive content in an integrated way. The standard way to treat the logical connectives in this approach is to associate them with the basic algebraic operations on these new types of meanings. For instance, conjunction and disjunction are treated as meet and join operators, just as in classical logic. This gives rise to a hybrid system, where sentences can be both informative and inquisitive at the same time, and there is no clearcut division between declaratives and interrogatives. It may seem that these two general approaches in the existing literature are quite incompatible. The main aim of this paper is to show that this is not the case. We develop an inquisitive semantics for a logical language that has a clearcut division between declaratives and interrogatives. We show that this language coincides in expressive power with the hybrid language that is standardly assumed in inquisitive semantics, we establish a sound and complete axiomatization for the associated logic, and we consider a natural enrichment of the system with presuppositional interrogatives.},

@incollection{Roelofsen:19disjunction,
	abstract = {There are two prominent treatments of disjunction in formal semantics. Traditionally, disjunction is taken to express an operator that applies to any two elements A and B of a Boolean algebra and yields their join. In particular, if A and B are propositions, then disjunction delivers their union, A ∪ B. Another, more recent proposal is to treat disjunction as expressing an operator that can apply to any two objects of the same semantic type, and yields the set consisting of these two objects. In particular, if disjunction applies to two propositions A and B, it delivers a set of propositional alternatives, {A, B}. Each of the two approaches has certain merits that the other one lacks. Thus, it would be desirable to reconcile the two, combining their respective strengths. This paper shows that this is indeed possible, if we adopt a notion of meaning that does not just take truth-conditional, informative content into consideration, but also inquisitive content.},

We argue that understanding the distribution and interpretation of polarity particles requires a characterization of declaratives and interrogatives that captures a series of challenging similarities and differences across these two sentence types. To meet this challenge we combine and extend insights from inquisitive semantics, dynamic semantics, and commitment-based models of discourse. We then provide a full account of the English data that leads to a typology of polarity particles and a series of crosslinguistic predictions. These predictions are checked against data from Romanian, Hungarian, French, and German, languages that contrast with English in that they have ternary polarity particle systems, and contrast with one another in further subtle ways.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an experiment that is designed to quantify the negativity of sentences with different types of negative operators (n-words like never and downward entailing operators like rarely) in different syntactic positions (adverb, subject, and direct object). In the experiment, participants were provided with a minimal context, then asked to choose one tag-question out of two; one of questions had a positive tag and the other had a negative tag. Clearly positive sentences (i.e., sentences without any negative operators) and clearly negative sentences (i.e., sentences with overt sentential negation and no other relevant operators present) were used as controls. The relative frequency of positive and negative tags was then taken as a measure of the sentential negativity of each experimental item. Our main finding is that sentential negativity is a graded notion, sensitive to both semantic and syntactic factors. With respect to semantics, we find that n-words contribute more negativity than downward entailing operators, confirming the logical distinction between anti-additivity and downward entailment identified in the previous semantic literature on NPI licensing. With respect to syntactic position, we find that negative items in subject or adverbial position contribute more negativity than negative items in direct object position.},

	abstract = {In classical logic, the proposition expressed by a sentence is construed as a set of possible worlds, capturing the informative content of the sentence. However, sentences in natural language are not only used to provide information, but also to request information. Thus, natural language semantics requires a logical framework whose notion of meaning does not only embody informative content, but also inquisitive content. This paper develops the algebraic foundations for such a framework. We argue that propositions, in order to embody both informative and inquisitive content in a satisfactory way, should be defined as non-empty, downward closed sets of possibilities, where each possibility in turn is a set of possible worlds. We define a natural entailment order over such propositions, capturing when one proposition is at least as informative and inquisitive as another, and we show that this entailment order gives rise to a complete Heyting algebra, with meet, join, and relative pseudo-complement operators. Just as in classical logic, these semantic operators are then associated with the logical constants in a first-order language. We explore the logical properties of the resulting system and discuss its significance for natural language semantics. We show that the system essentially coincides with the simplest and most well-understood existing implementation of inquisitive semantics, and that its treatment of disjunction and existentials also concurs with recent work in alternative semantics. Thus, our algebraic considerations do not lead to a wholly new treatment of the logical constants, but rather provide more solid foundations for some of the existing proposals.},

This paper presents three experiments using two novel strategies based on polarity particles and VP ellipsis to test the predictions of this treatment of n-words. The first experiment tests a particular prediction of recent accounts of polarity particles with respect to agreeing responses to negative assertions. The other two extend the inquiry to cases involving n-words.

@inproceedings{Roelofsen:11,
	abstract = {In classical logic, the proposition expressed by a sentence is construed as a set of possible worlds, capturing the informative content of the sentence. However, sentences in natural language are not only used to provide information, but also to request information. Thus, natural language semantics requires a logical framework whose notion of meaning does not only embody informative content, but also inquisitive content. This paper develops the algebraic foundations for such a framework. We argue that propositions, in order to embody both informative and inquisitive content in a satisfactory way, should be defined as non-empty, downward closed sets of possibilities, where each possibility in turn is a set of possible worlds. We define a natural entailment order over such propositions, capturing when one proposition is at least as informative and inquisitive as another, and we show that this entailment order gives rise to a complete Heyting algebra, with meet, join, and relative pseudo-complement operators. Just as in classical logic, these semantic operators are then associated with the logical constants in a first-order language. We explore the logical properties of the resulting system and discuss its significance for natural language semantics. We show that the system essentially coincides with the simplest and most well-understood existing implementation of inquisitive semantics, and that its treatment of disjunction and existentials also concurs with recent work in alternative semantics. Thus, our algebraic considerations do not lead to a wholly new treatment of the logical constants, but rather provide more solid foundations for some of the existing proposals.},

	abstract = {Concealed questions are determiner phrases that are naturally paraphrased as embedded questions (e.g., John knows the capital of Italy ≈ John knows what the capital of Italy is). This paper offers a novel account of the interpretation of concealed questions, which assumes that an entity-denoting expression α may be type-shifted into an expression ?z.P(α), where P is a contextually determined property, and z ranges over a contextually determined domain of individual concepts. Different resolutions of P and the domain of z yield a wide range of concealed question interpretations, some of which were not noted previously. On the other hand, principled constraints on the resolution process prevent overgeneration.},

	abstract = {This paper examines how intonation affects the interpretation of disjunctive questions. The semantic effect of a question is taken to be three-fold. First, it raises an issue. In the tradition of inquisitive semantics, we model this by assuming that a question proposes several possible updates of the common ground (several possibilities for short) and invites other participants to help establish at least one of these updates. But apart from raising an issue, a question may also highlight and/or suggest certain possibilities, and intonation determines to a large extent which possibilities are highlighted/suggested.},

The focus of the paper will be on the logical pragmatical notions that the semantics gives rise to. We introduce and motivate inquisitive versions of principles of cooperation, which direct a conversation towards enhancement of the common ground. We define a notion of compliance, which judges relatedness of one utterance to another, and a notion of homogeneity, which enables quantitative comparison of compliant moves. We end the paper with an illustration of the cooperative way in which implicatures are established, or cancelled, in inquisitive pragmatics.},

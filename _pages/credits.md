## Developed tools

For this website we developed some useful tools:

  ouputs a value from an object, but uses a data file for the default values.

  for typesetting time periods (e.g. 26–28 July)

  a script that filters the publication list rendered by BibBase. This script
  was based on a script by Floris Roelofsen.

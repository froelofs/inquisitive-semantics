  The aim of the Inquisitive Turn project (2010-2015) has been to develop a new perspective on meaning in semantics, logic, and pragmatics, which places informative and inquisitive content on equal footing.


  The closing event of the project will consist of **two workshops**. The event will be directly followed by the [Amsterdam Colloquium](http://www.illc.uva.nl/AC/AC2015/) (December 16-18).

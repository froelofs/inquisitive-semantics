  This course explores some recent developments in the field of logic.

  First, and more specifically, the course is an introduction to the
  growing field of inquisitive logic. Classically, logic is concerned with
  relations between sentences of a particular kind, namely, statements.
  Inquisitive logic broadens this classical view of logic by bringing
  questions into the picture. We will see that questions, while
  traditionally neglected, actually have an important role to play in
  logic: they can participate in entailment relations and manipulated in
  inferences, they can be combined by connectives and quantifiers, and
  they give rise to an elegant mathematical theory.

  Second, and more broadly, the course explores the information-based
  perspective on logic. While this perspective is crucial to inquisitive
  logic, it plays an equally important role in other recent developments,
  such as dependence logic and accounts of the logic of epistemic vocabulary.

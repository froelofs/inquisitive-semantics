description: >
    Traditionally, logic is concerned with the characterization of valid reasoning and argumentation, and therefore identifies the meaning of a sentence with its truth conditions. When analyzing the meaning of sentences in conversation, however, other notions become of interest as well. The focus of the course will be on **inquisitive semantics**, which enriches the traditional truth-conditional approach in ways that allow for a more comprehensive formal analysis of the meaning of sentences in linguistic interaction. The course introduces the basic inquisitive semantics framework, and discusses some current research in this area. This year, we will focus in particular on the semantics of **attitude verbs** like *know*, *believe*, and *wonder*. Why, for instance, is *believe* typically incompatible with interrogative complements (*Sue believes who arrived* is not a good sentence) and *wonder* typically incompatible with declarative complements (*Sue wonders that Mary arrived* is not good either) while *know* can take either type of complement (*Sue knows who arrived* / *Sue knows that Mary arrived*). Is this an artifact of English grammar, or do we see the same pattern in other languages? Can such distributive constraints be explained based on the semantic properties of these verbs? Recent work has argued that we can indeed provide such explanations, and obtain a deeper understanding of attitude verbs more generally, if we adopt a formal semantic framework in which semantic content is not identified with truth-conditional content but also comprises inquisitive content.

## Prerequisites

Good working knowledge of first-order logic is required (see for instance the first three chapters of
[this book](http://users.uoa.gr/~wlechner/Creteling2017/Textbooks/Gamut%201991%20vol%201.pdf)).
It is also convenient to have some background in formal semantics (see for instance [this book](https://eecoppock.info/bootcamp/semantics-boot-camp.pdf)),
though this is not strictly required. For students of the Master of Logic, it is typically best to take this course in the second year of the programme, after having taken **Meaning, Reference and Modality** and **Structures for Semantics** during the first year. There may be exceptions, depending on your specific background.

## Textbook

The first part of the course uses a textbook. The book is open access, so everyone can download a [pdf](http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/academic/pdf/openaccess/9780198814788.pdf) for free. If you prefer a hardcopy, you can order one at [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Inquisitive-Semantics-Oxford-Surveys-Pragmatics/dp/0198814798/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1602181605&sr=8-1) or other online bookstores.

## Grading

The grade will be based on one **data collection exercise** (pass/fail), two **homework assignments** (each counting for 20%), and a **final paper** (60%).
  
## Assignments

- A latex template for drawing inquisitive semantics diagrams can be downloaded [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources.html).  
- The [data collection exercise](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/f9iivnlzewuqy2f1romkf/LC_Assignment_1.pdf?rlkey=h3ljshkz5q0is9mly5vivrsz5&dl=0) was posted on Monday 30/10 and will be due on Monday 13/11 before class.
- [Assignment 1](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/17bvtqhlxiebkii6p25s5/LC-2023-assignment1.pdf?rlkey=e4wzrjb6evm9duolb8w0vhtp5&dl=0) has been posted on Thursday 2/11 and is due on Thursday 16/11 before class.  
- Assignment 2 will be posted on Monday 13/11 and will be due on Monday 27/11 before class.  
<!-- - [Assignment 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2pb52ai6w3fzzu8/LC-2020-assignment2.pdf?dl=0) was posted on 9/11 and is due on Friday 20/11 before class. -->
  
## Instructions for final paper

The final paper must written individually. Please discuss possible topics with us early on in the course. Topics should be determined by **November 30** at the very latest and should be communicated to us by that date. A preliminary version of the paper is to be presented during the last lecture on **December 14**, and the final version is due on **December 22, 6pm**. See Appendix B of the textbook and the inquisitive semantics website for pointers to some relevant literature, which may help in finding an interesting topic. We strongly encourage students to discuss their projects with each other and give each other feedback.

## Grading criteria for final paper

The grading criteria for the final paper are the same as for a master thesis, though of course here we do not expect as much as in the case of a thesis.

1. **Correctness** All claims should be correct, precisely formulated and carefully argued for.
2. **Writing** The paper should be well-structured; the writing should be clear and concise. Typically, papers are around 10 pages. There is no official upper or lower bound, but quality is preferred over quantity: a single idea or result that is clearly explained in 7 pages is better than a collection of multiple half-baked ideas discussed in 15 pages.
3. **Difficulty** Both conceptual and technical difficulty are taken into account.
4. **Originality** The paper should contain some new results. This can take many forms: establishing previously unknown properties of one of the logical systems discussed in class, or closely related ones; further enriching the theories discussed; testing the predictions of the theories; developing new applications; developing a theory of your own that solves some of the remaining challenges for the theories discussed.

## Late policy

Deadlines are strict. Late submissions will be accepted until three days after the deadline, but 0.5 points will be subtracted from the grade per day.

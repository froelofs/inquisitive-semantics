description: >
    Traditionally, logic is concerned with the characterization of valid reasoning and argumentation, and therefore identifies the meaning of a sentence with its truth conditions. When analyzing the meaning of sentences in conversation, however, other notions become of interest as well. The course focuses on the important role of **alternatives** in linguistic interpretation. The first part of the course concentrates on the role of alternatives in the semantics of **questions**, as analysed in the framework of **inquisitive semantics**. The second part focusses on the role of alternatives in the interpretation of **indefinite referential expressions**, as analysed in **dynamic semantics** and related frameworks.

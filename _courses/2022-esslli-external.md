  Logic is concerned with relations among sentences, such as entailment and consistency, logical operations on sentences, and how sentences can be arranged into valid arguments. Traditionally, however, logic has focused on a special class of sentences, namely, statements, which can be true or false. The course makes a case for extending logic beyond statements to encompass also questions, and describes how such an extension can be achieved in the framework of inquisitive logic. We will see that once logic is generalized to questions, important logical notions such as answerhood and dependency emerge as facets of the fundamental notion of entailment, and can thereby be analyzed using the logician’s toolkit. After motivating the enterprise and introducing the conceptual foundations of the framework, we will look at how classical propositional and predicate logic can be enriched with questions and study the meta-theoretic properties of the resulting logics.

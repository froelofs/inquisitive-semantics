description: >
  The course aims to familiarize students with recent developments in semantics and pragmatics, focusing on assertions, questions, and a range of 'hybrid' discourse moves that combine features of both. At a theoretical level, it integrates recent work in inquisitive semantics with work on discourse structure, refining and enriching both. Empirically, it covers a range of discourse initiatives and responses to them, presenting in‐depth analyses of cross‐linguistic data from English, German, French, Romanian, and Hungarian.

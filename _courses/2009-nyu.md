## Course material TODO fix links
- [Sheets](https://sites.google.com/site/inquisitivesemantics/courses/nyu-seminar-spring-2009/NYUInqSemPragm.key.pdf?attredirects=0) of the **first meeting**.
- Background reading: Chapters 1-2 of [Questions in Dynamic Semantics](https://sites.google.com/site/inquisitivesemantics/courses/nyu-seminar-spring-2009/CrispiCh1and2.pdf?attredirects=0) (eds. Aloni, Butler and Dekker). Introductory chapter by the editors on the Semantics and Pragmatics of Questions, and my 1999 SALT paper The Logic of Interrogation.
- [Sheets](https://sites.google.com/site/inquisitivesemantics/courses/nyu-seminar-spring-2009/Lect2NYUInqSemPragm.pdf?attredirects=0) of the **second meeting**.
- Reading material: the Tbilisi-paper [Inquisitive Semantics: Two Possibilities for Disjunction](https://sites.google.com/site/inquisitivesemantics/courses/nyu-seminar-spring-2009/TbilisiJeroen.pdf?attredirects=0) and the much more extended [Inquisitive Semantics: Student Version](https://sites.google.com/site/inquisitivesemantics/system/errors/NodeNotFound?suri=wuid:gx:62865494e7006707), which also has inquisitive semantics for predicate logic as an appendix. On the page [Papers](https://sites.google.com/site/inquisitivesemantics/system/errors/NodeNotFound?suri=wuid:gx:4a902a010bfea16b) you find the Tbilisi paper in a slightly longer concept version, and Salvador Mascarenhas' paper you find there gives you some further material.
- The **third meeting** on Feb. 18 was a 'blackboard meeting', see Chris' picture above. I will put the material I covered (much of it can also be found in the last part of the sheets of the second meeting),  in a **handout** for the **fourth meeting** of Feb. 25, with new material as well, of course.
- On the **fourth meeting** on Feb. 25 I used a handout. in the meantime this has turned into a draft paper [AssertionsQuestionsHybrids.pdf](https://sites.google.com/site/inquisitivesemantics/courses/nyu-seminar-spring-2009/AssertionsQuestionsHybrids.pdf?attredirects=0) . I will notify and publish updates of the paper-to-be here.
- On the **5th and 6th meeting** on March 25 and April 1, I discussed a new paper that Floris Roelofsen and I just finished on [inquisitive semantics and pragmatics](https://sites.google.com/site/inquisitivesemantics/documents/SanSebDefFrozen.pdf?attredirects=0).

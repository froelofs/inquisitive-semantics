description: >
  The course relates to a recently started NWO-research project on inquisitive semantics, logic, and pragmatics. Inquisitive semantics offers a new logical-semantical model for the interpretation of natural language. The proposition expressed by a sentence is viewed as a proposal to update the common ground of a conversation, where it is a characteristic of inquisitive semantics that a speaker may draw attention to several alternative possibilities for updating the common ground, from which the hearer is invited to choose. The new semantic framework gives rise to new directions for the study of pragmatics, and also leads to new logical research questions.\

  In the first part of the course we discuss the logical and philosophical foundations of inquisitive semantics and pragmatics, and will illustrate its applications in several empirical linguistic domains. The last part of the course is intended to have the nature of a research colloquium. Students will choose a small research project on logical, philosophical or linguistic aspects of inquisitive semantics and pragmatics, write a small research report, and present their findings to the other students.

The purpose of the mid-term paper is to identify one or more issues that you would like to investigate further during the second half of the course, and to sketch your preliminary thoughts about these issues in a short paper (5-10 pages). You are free to pick a topic that is logically oriented, or more linguistic, or more philosophical, whatever fits your interests best. If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with us.

- **Reading material for 20/10**\

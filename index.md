# What is inquisitive semantics?

Inquisitive semantics is a semantic framework that is based on a formal notion of meaning which, unlike the traditional truth-conditional notion, captures both informative and inquisitive content. The framework allows for a unified analysis of statements and questions, as well as linguistic elements that interact with both statements and questions, such as modals, quantifiers, connectives, and discourse particles.
